# msvpvf
msvpvf.py, based on msvpvf which can be found [here](https://www.focusonvegas.com/movie-studio-vegas-pro-version-faker/)

this could probably be very heavily optimized but it works for now

# compatibility
as far as i know, there are 3 generations of project files:

Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Gen 3
--- | --- | ---
8.0 - 11.0 | 12.0 - 14.0 | 15.0 - Now

of course, all generations later than the generation before can open these files, for example vegas 14 can open vegas 10 project files

feel free to correct me on this, i haven't used 15.0+ in over 2 years
